# Deploy Strapi to Render

This is a sample [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) app, configured for deployment to [Render](https://render.com). It uses a [managed PostgreSQL database](https://render.com/docs/databases) to store structured content and [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) to store and serve uploaded media files.

To deploy, create a Cloudinary account and make note of your cloud name, api key, and api secret. Then fork this repo and click the button below. Fill in your Cloudinary account details when prompted.

## Test Strapi v4

We plan to update this repository to v4 of Strapi shortly after [StrapiConf 2022](https://conf.strapi.io), however you may test out v4 on Render now by selecting the [`crc/upgrade-to-v4`](https://github.com/render-examples/strapi-postgres-cloudinary/tree/crc/upgrade-to-v4) branch during deploy.
